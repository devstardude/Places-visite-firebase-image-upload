### 🌟 Introduction 
--- 
Want to Track the places you visit with a Great UI and User Experience?<br/>
<strong>Place Visité</strong> is the Solution.<br/>
This is a Feature-Rich app in which you can add and remove places you visited to your profile and also see where other people have been going.<br/>
You just need to make an account, write your address and Boom, your coordinates are Fetched with <strong>Inbuilt Geocoding</strong>.<br/>
Furthermore, you can see your location on <strong>Google maps inside the app</strong>.

### 🏖️ How Does It Work
---
On the homepage, you'll see all the other users and places they visited.<br/>
To add your place just Sign-Up/Sign-In with your Email and click on Add place, then Fill out the Details form.<br/>
Just pay special attention while filling Address Field, as it will be used to fetch coordinates of that place via Geocoding.<br/>
So try to be as accurate as possible.<br/>
